## Overview

FlashGuard is a tool for individuals with Photosensitive Epilepsy (PSE) to use on their devices to shield against flashing lights, colors, or other dangerous stimuli that would otherwise cause seizures in PSE.

FlashGuard runs in __real-time__ in the __background__, allowing users to use their devices normally while being __shielding from flashing content__. By tracking the rate of change of flashing being displayed on the screen, if the flashing surpasses a threshold for which the machine learning model has learned from, then FlashGuard will __dim the screen__ to prevent excessive flash intensity to the user.

_Note: FlashGuard is not 100% accurate at detecting dangerous content all the time; there may be false negatives and (more likely) false positives (but better safe than sorry!)_ 


## Installation

** FlashGuard is currently only available to Windows users. Mac/Linux versions will come soon.

To install FlashGuard, click on FlashGuard.exe in the directory above. Then, download the raw file.
*Alternatively, just click [__this link__](https://github.com/IshPen/FlashGuard/raw/refs/heads/main/FlashGuard.exe?download=) to download directly.*

****Important**** - FlashGuard may be flagged as a false postive by antivirus programs, including Microsoft Defender. This will prevent FlashGuard from working/running, so you will need to add the path of FlashGuard as an exclusion: 
 - [Add exclusion for Windows Defender](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/virus-and-threat-protection-in-the-windows-security-app-1362f4cd-d71a-b52a-0b66-c2820032b65e)


Once FlashGuard downloads to your computer, you will be able to
 - Save it to your desktop
 - Add it to taskbar
 - [Have it run on computer startup (instructions linked)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configure-startup-applications-in-windows-115a420a-0bff-4a6f-90e0-1934c844e47)
